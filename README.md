# belly-button-challenge

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

You locate my javascript in the static/js folder in the file app.js and my HTML in the index.html file. My HTML and website are initalized here: https://arf15da.github.io/belly-button-challenge/

I had a difficult time with this challenege. But I hope the work done here will be up to standard. Please let me know if you have any question!
